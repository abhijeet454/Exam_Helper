## Configuration

Key configuration variables are defined at the top of the script:
```python
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 1000
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB = 50
CACHE_TTL = 3600  # 1 hour
MAX_CACHED_ENTRIES = 10
```

## Architecture

The application consists of several key components:
- **UserVectorStore**: Manages vector stores for multiple users with concurrent access support.
- **get_study_chain**: Configures the question-answering chain with different response lengths.
- **get_pdf_text**: Extracts text and figures from PDF documents.
- **get_vector_store**: Creates and manages FAISS vector stores for document embeddings.
- **process_question**: Handles question processing and answer generation.
- **create_pdf**: Generates formatted PDF exports of Q&A sessions.

---

## Security Considerations
- All PDFs are processed locally.
- No data is stored permanently.
- Automatic cleanup of old sessions.
- Rate limiting protection.
- Concurrent access management.
- File size restrictions.
